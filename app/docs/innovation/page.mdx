# Innovation Points

## Core Innovations

### 1. 20/80 Prefunding Model

#### Innovation
A novel approach to leverage trading where borrowers provide 20% collateral and the community pre-funds 80% of the loan amount.

#### Technical Implementation
```solidity
function createLoan(uint256 loanAmount) public {
    uint256 collateralAmount = loanAmount * 20 / 100;
    uint256 poolAmount = loanAmount * 80 / 100;
    
    // Transfer collateral from borrower
    IERC20(USDC).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralAmount);
    
    // Allocate from pool
    lendingPool.allocateFunds(msg.sender, poolAmount);
    
    // Create restricted wallet
    address wallet = restrictedWalletFactory.getOrCreateWallet(msg.sender);
    
    // Transfer combined capital
    IERC20(USDC).transfer(wallet, loanAmount);
}
```

#### Benefits
- **5x Capital Efficiency**: Achieves 5x leverage with minimal collateral
- **Risk Sharing**: Both borrowers and LPs benefit from successful trades
- **Immediate Access**: No waiting for individual lenders
- **Transparent**: All operations visible on-chain

### 2. Restricted Smart Wallets

#### Innovation
Chain-enforced trading wallets that limit operations to whitelisted protocols only, preventing unauthorized fund drainage.

#### Technical Implementation
```solidity
function execute(address target, bytes calldata data) public onlyOwner {
    // Validate target is whitelisted
    require(whitelistedProtocols[target], "Protocol not whitelisted");
    
    // Validate function selector
    bytes4 selector = bytes4(data[:4]);
    require(whitelistedFunctions[selector], "Function not whitelisted");
    
    // Execute call
    (bool success, ) = target.call(data);
    require(success, "Call failed");
}
```

#### Benefits
- **Zero Trust**: No human oversight required
- **Automated Enforcement**: Smart contract-level restrictions
- **Transparent**: All rules visible on-chain
- **Secure**: Prevents unauthorized access

### 3. ERC-4626 Liquidity Vaults

#### Innovation
Standardized vault system using ERC-4626 for liquidity provider deposits, ensuring compatibility with existing DeFi infrastructure.

#### Technical Implementation
```solidity
contract LendingPool is ERC4626 {
    function deposit(uint256 assets) public returns (uint256 shares) {
        // Transfer assets from user
        IERC20(asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
        
        // Calculate shares based on current rate
        shares = convertToShares(assets);
        
        // Mint shares to user
        _mint(msg.sender, shares);
        
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.sender, assets, shares);
    }
}
```

#### Benefits
- **Standard Compliance**: Compatible with existing DeFi protocols
- **Automated Yield**: Share-based accounting with yield accrual
- **Transparent**: Standardized interface for monitoring
- **Composable**: Easy integration with other protocols

### 4. On-Chain Risk Management

#### Innovation
Automated risk management through smart contracts, eliminating human judgment and ensuring consistent enforcement.

#### Technical Implementation
```solidity
function calculateHealthFactor(address borrower) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 positionValue = getPositionValue(borrower);
    uint256 loanAmount = getLoanAmount(borrower);
    
    return (positionValue * 100) / loanAmount;
}

function isLiquidatable(address borrower) public view returns (bool) {
    return calculateHealthFactor(borrower) < 100;
}
```

#### Benefits
- **Automated**: No human intervention required
- **Consistent**: Same rules for all users
- **Transparent**: All calculations visible on-chain
- **Fair**: Equal treatment for all participants
