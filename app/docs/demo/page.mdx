## Demo Script

### Introduction (1 minute)
"Today I'll demonstrate Invalend Protocol, a safe-leverage protocol that allows traders to unlock 5x buying power using only 20% of their own capital. The remaining 80% is transparently provided by a shared liquidity pool."

### Problem Statement (1 minute)
"Current DeFi leverage protocols require excessive collateral for leverage, limiting capital efficiency. Invalend addresses this through a 20/80 prefunding model with chain-enforced restrictions and transparent execution."

### Core Mechanism (2 minutes)
"Let me show you how the 20/80 prefunding mechanism works. A DAO wants to deploy $500K but only has $100K available. They create a loan, deposit 20% collateral, and the community pre-funds 80%. The combined capital goes to a restricted wallet that can only trade on whitelisted protocols."

### Live Demo (8 minutes)
- **DAO Scenario** (5 minutes)
- **Trader Scenario** (3 minutes)

### Key Differentiators (2 minutes)
"Invalend provides 5x capital efficiency through the 20/80 prefunding model. Restrictions are enforced at the smart contract level, and the protocol focuses on institutional use cases with professional-grade infrastructure."

### Technical Highlights (2 minutes)
"Built on Base with Uniswap V4 integration, ERC-4626 standard vaults, and comprehensive testing. All transactions are on-chain and transparent."

### Q&A (3 minutes)
Answer questions about:
- Security and risk management
- Oracle integration plans
- Yield generation mechanisms
- Cross-chain deployment plans
