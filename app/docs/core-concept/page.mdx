# Core Concept & Definition

## Core Concept

### Safe-Leverage Protocol

Invalend is a decentralized leverage trading protocol that enables users to access 5x leverage while protecting liquidity providers through a 20/80 prefunding model and chain-enforced restrictions.

**Key Elements:**

- **Safety**: LPs are protected by borrower margin requirements
- **Leverage**: Up to 5x capital efficiency achieved
- **Protocol**: Decentralized, on-chain execution
- **Restrictions**: Chain-enforced trading boundaries

### 20/80 Prefunding Model

The protocol's core mechanism that enables safe leverage through community prefunding.

**Mechanism:**

- **Borrower Contribution**: 20% collateral (margin)
- **Pool Contribution**: 80% funding from liquidity pool
- **Combined Capital**: Up to 5x leverage for trading
- **Risk Distribution**: Both parties benefit from successful trades

**Benefits:**

- **Capital Efficiency**: 5x more efficient than traditional lending
- **Risk Sharing**: Distributed between borrower and pool
- **LP Protection**: Losses never exceed borrower margin
- **Transparent Execution**: All actions visible on-chain

## Definitions

### Key Terms

**Borrower**

- Individual or entity seeking leverage for trading
- Provides 20% collateral (margin)
- Gains access to 5x trading capital
- Maintains control within restricted wallet

**Liquidity Provider (LP)**

- Individual or entity providing capital to the pool

- Protected by borrower margin requirements
- Benefits from successful trading activity

**Restricted Wallet**

- Smart contract wallet created for each borrower
- Enforces whitelist-only protocol access
- Prevents unauthorized external transfers
- Enables trading control within defined boundaries

**Margin**

- 20% collateral provided by borrower
- First to absorb any trading losses
- Enables access to 5x leverage
- Protects LP principal

**Pool**

- ERC-4626 vault containing LP deposits
- Provides 80% funding for loans
- Earns yield from trading activity
- Protected by borrower margin

**Health Factor**

- Real-time calculation of position health
- Based on collateral value versus loan amount
- Triggers liquidation when below threshold

- Enables immediate access to leverage
- No waiting for individual lenders
- Pool-based capital allocation

**Risk Engine**

- On-chain system for risk management
- Real-time margin tracking
- P&L calculation and monitoring
- Automated liquidation execution
